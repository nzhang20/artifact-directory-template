Title:
Causal Discovery on Gut Microbial Data for Disease Risk Prediction

Abstract:
The human gut microbiome has become a significant factor in understanding
metabolic health, influencing conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Despite its recognized impact, much of
the current research on the human gut microbiome and diseases remain limited to associative and correlational studies, leaving gaps in understanding
the underlying causal relationships. This study addresses these gaps by utilizing causal discovery algorithms and causal inference methods and comparing them with prediction models to investigate microbial contributions to T2D
and PCOS. First, we graph the microbe-microbe interaction networks on the
genus level for healthy and diseased cohorts using a version of the Peter-Clark
(PC) algorithm altered to reduce the multiple testing burden. Then, we graph
the microbe-disease interaction network on the genus level for a disease using the constraint-based causal discovery from heterogeneous/nonstationary
data algorithm (CD-NOD) and compare the microbes directly linked to disease with microbes from a variational autoencoder (VAE) prediction model.
Our results show that there are microbes causal to T2D and microbes causal
to PCOS (expand). This work aims to provide a framework for investigating
causal relationships between the gut microbiome and other diseases as well
as guide further research and wet-lab experiments and develop a stronger
understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in precision medicine.
